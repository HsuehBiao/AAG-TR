# AAG-TR
The code for paper "Adaptive Anchor Graph Learning with Tensor Regularization for Multi-View Clustering".

If you are interested in our work, you can try running `runrunrun.m` on the `BDGP_fea.mat` dataset.

If you want to test our method on other datasets, first tune the parameters using `parameter_of_demo.m`, then run repeated experiments with `runrunrun.m`.
